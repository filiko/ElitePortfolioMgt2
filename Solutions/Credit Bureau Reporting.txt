Credit Bureau Reporting
Optional. Compliant. Powerful.
As part of our full-service recovery solutions, Elite Portfolio Management offers optional credit bureau reporting to enhance your collection strategy — at no additional cost.
We report only with your authorization, and we handle every file with full adherence to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and all applicable regulations. Disputed accounts are flagged appropriately, and all consumer data is transmitted securely and responsibly.
