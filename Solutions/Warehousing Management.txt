Warehousing Management
Turn Dormant Accounts Into Long-Term Revenue
Just because an account hasn’t paid today doesn’t mean it won’t pay tomorrow.
At Elite Portfolio Management, our Warehousing Management service keeps your “end of life” accounts securely monitored, analytically scored, and ready for recovery when the timing is right. We don’t give up on dormant placements — we strategically pause and track them until a favorable recovery window opens.
This service is ideal for aged accounts that are still legally collectable but not currently yielding results.

How It Works
●	Secure Data Holding

 We retain and monitor accounts that are past standard collection efforts, while ensuring full compliance with data retention laws.

●	Real-Time Triggers

 Our system scans multiple national databases continuously to detect credit activity, employment updates, asset shifts, or other signs of renewed collectability.

●	Proprietary Scoring & Analytics

 We re-score and prioritize accounts based on updated financial behavior, payment capacity, and risk indicators.

●	Cost-Effective Strategy

 Warehoused accounts are held at lower servicing rates, with full recovery efforts only reinitiated when there’s true potential to collect.
