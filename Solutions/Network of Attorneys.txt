Nationwide Legal Network
Strategic Legal Escalation When It Matters Most
While over 98% of debts are resolved without the need for litigation, certain situations demand a formal legal response. Elite Portfolio Management offers comprehensive nationwide legal support through a vetted network of experienced collection attorneys — so when legal action is required, you have the infrastructure in place to act decisively and compliantly.

Trusted Legal Representation — Anywhere in the U.S.
●	National Attorney Network

 Our partners include licensed, bonded, and highly rated collection attorneys operating across all 50 states and U.S. jurisdictions.

●	Centralized Legal Oversight

 You don’t have to manage multiple firms. We oversee every claim — from filing to settlement — through our centralized system, so you get full visibility and efficiency from one point of contact.

●	Client-Directed Legal Strategy

 No lawsuit is initiated and no settlement is accepted without your explicit approval. The attorney represents you, and we manage the communication, documentation, and execution on your behalf.

When Legal Action Is Warranted
Before recommending litigation, Elite conducts a collectability review including:
●	Asset investigation

●	Employment verification

●	Statute of limitations review

●	Compliance checklists and jurisdiction-specific risk analysis

If legal action is deemed appropriate, we’ll walk you through every step and provide all relevant case data so you can make an informed decision.
