Secondary & Tertiary Collections
Strategic Recovery for Hard-to-Collect Accounts
Even after a primary agency fails to resolve an account, that debt isn’t a lost cause. Elite Portfolio Management specializes in secondary and tertiary placements — giving clients a second (and third) chance to maximize recovery on previously worked, low-performing accounts.
Our seasoned team brings a fresh strategy, modern tools, and deep compliance expertise to portfolios other agencies couldn’t collect — with a proven ability to recover value while preserving consumer goodwill.

Why Elite for Secondary & Tertiary?
●	Fresh Perspective, Better Results

 Accounts that other firms couldn’t resolve receive new attention from our skilled agents, powered by real-time data and AI-supported contact logic.

●	Advanced Segmentation

 We re-analyze your uncollected inventory using updated analytics, contact modeling, and behavioral scoring to identify where recovery is still viable.

●	Brand-Conscious Communication

 Our approach prioritizes professionalism and respect. Even late-stage accounts are treated with care and transparency — aligned with your public image.

●	Motivation for Your First Agency

 In many cases, assigning accounts to a secondary agency encourages better performance from your primary firm, knowing their time to collect is limited.
